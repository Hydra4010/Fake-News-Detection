## 📌 Project Overview

Fake news spreads rapidly on social media and news platforms, causing misinformation and confusion.

This project uses **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect whether a news article is **Real or Fake**.

The model is trained on a large dataset of news articles and predicts the authenticity of new news content.
